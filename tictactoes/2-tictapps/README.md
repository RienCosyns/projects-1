# TIC TAC TOE 2 - Express File Structure
This seris of mini-apps progresses from simple MVC objects to a full Express-like file structure.   
  
As before, be sure to use development branches and to add this to your 'tictactoes' github repo.  
  
Study it like you did for tictactoes 1  
  
fun challenge: near the end, create a function or object that abstracts dom contact away from the controller object.  ie. anything that is 'document.*' in the controller should be in a separate object that calls the controller
